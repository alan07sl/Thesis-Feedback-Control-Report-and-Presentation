\chapter{Controlling overproduction}
\label{chap:exploring-the-problem-space}
In the previous chapter we established the definition of a \textit{reactive program} in terms of its behavior, how it is implemented in Rx, what the danger is of having an overproducing \obs and which solutions already exist to solve this problem. In this chapter we will discuss these solutions in further detail, consider their advantages and disadvantages and argue which solutions work for the various kinds of streams. Based on this discussion we will propose a new approach for controlling the flow of an overproducing \obs.
