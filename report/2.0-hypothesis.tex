\todo{come up with a good title for this chapter}

In the previous chapter we established what being \textit{reactive} means, how it is implemented in Rx, what the danger is of having an overproducing \obs and which solutions already exist for this problem. In this chapter we will discuss these solutions, consider their pros and cons and finally propose a new solution to this problem that combines the earlier solutions by taking their good parts. We will do so by first revisiting \textit{hot} and \textit{cold} streams and make some observations on their origin \todo{blablabla}. With these observations, we will discuss the already existing solutions \todo{continue here...}
