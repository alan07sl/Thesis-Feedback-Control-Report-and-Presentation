\chapter{Conclusion}

In this final chapter we will reiterate the main contributions of our research, revisit the research questions and discuss both the limitations of our research and future work that arose from this report. The goal of this research is to analyze the problem of overproduction in reactive programming (that is, a producer that produces more data than the consumer can deal with), to examine its currently existing solutions and to come up with a new way to prevent overproduction from happening.
