\chapter{Solving overproduction with feedback control}
\label{chap:solving-overproduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Distinction between hot and cold - we're only considering cold, as hot is not able to handle backpressure
	\item Bring handling backpressure to the start of the stream
	\item Feedback control of buffer - general overview of idea + diagram
	\item Requestable interface
		\begin{itemize}
			\item request items and let them come down the stream on their own terms (i.e. in a reactive way)
			\item some implementations of Requestable (iterable collection, Database ResultSet)
		\end{itemize}
	\item Implementation of BackpressureObservable
		\begin{itemize}
			\item feedback system fills the queue
			\item reactively pull data from the queue and send it downstream (exposed as Observable)
		\end{itemize}
	\item Controller
		\begin{itemize}
			\item PID control, why it doesn't work here
			\item relation with Janert
			\item incremental controller
		\end{itemize}
	\item How it works in practice
		\begin{itemize}
			\item backpressure examples, but then with the feedback solution
			\item show graphs of how many items get requested each time
		\end{itemize}
	\item Conclusion
\end{itemize}
