\chapter{Problem statement}

In order to have a good understanding of what the true meaning and problem with backpressure is, it is important to first of all define what \textit{reactive programming} is, what its relation to other programming patterns is and how this paradigm is implemented in the \textit{Reactive Extensions} API, which will be used throughout this thesis.

In order to understand these fundamental principles, this chapter starts off with defining what reactive programming is, as it is described in the literature. This paradigm forms the basis of this whole thesis, therefore it is important to establish the notion of reactiveness first.

Then the Reactive Extensions API is discussed, which is both the context in which backpressure occurs and the basis of the tools we will be using to solve this problem. Since this API is not yet considered to be common knowledge and since not much literature is based on it, we will start from the very basics and discuss all the concepts necessary for this thesis.

At the end of this chapter backpressure is introduces, as well as some previous work that provides solutions to this problem and which is discussed and used in future chapters.
