\section{An extended example}
To get a better feel for how a feedback control system works in practice, we will discuss an interesting application of feedback control that uses the theory covered in the previous sections. In this section we show a reference implementation that can be ported into any language. We will continue to use and refactor this application in the next chapter, as we come up with an API for constructing and running feedback systems. The application at hand is a port from the original implementation by Nikita Leshenko in Javascript, CSS and HTML \cite{nikital-balltracker}. We will however use Scala as our programming language and JavaFx for drawing the graphics on the screen.
