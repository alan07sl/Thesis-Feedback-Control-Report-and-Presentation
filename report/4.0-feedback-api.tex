\chapter{An API for feedback control}

\todo{content here}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Since we do feedback control for computer science, we want to come up with an API to create feedback systems
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A good API does not yet exist
		\item Some simple stuff in Python
		\item Solution from Peti Koch
	\end{itemize}
	\item Introduce the ball tracker as a toy example
	\begin{itemize}
		\item First on 1 dimension; implemented with for-loops etc.
		\item Use this throughout the rest of the Feedback Control section
	\end{itemize}
	\item Feedback control as ‘working with streams’
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A component sits in between 2 streams and performs some sort of transformation
		\item A component is compositional: connecting components, making feedback loop, zipping $\rightarrow$ a feedback system is the same as a component
		\item Observation: \textbf{a component is the same as a Mealy Machine}
		\item Derive the exact type of a component, starting from a Mealy Machine and using category theory
		\item Observation: \textbf{a component is an Arrow}
		\item Introduce the operators on Component
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Arrow operators (see \LaTeX code)
%			\begin{itemize}
%				\item \code{arr :: Arrow a => (b -> c) -> a b c}
%				\item \code{(>>>) :: Arrow a => a b c -> a c d -> a b d}
%				\item \code{first :: Arrow a => a b c -> a (b,d) (c,d)}
%				\item \code{second :: Arrow a => a b c -> a (d,b) (d,c)}
%				\item \code{(***) :: Arrow a => a b c -> a d e -> a (b,d) (c,e)}
%				\item \code{(\&\&\&) :: Arrow a => a b c -> a b d -> a b (c,d)}
%				\item \code{lift2A :: Arrow a => (b -> c -> d) -> a e b ->   a e c -> a e d}
%				\item \code{loop :: Arrow a => a (b,d) (c,d) -> a b c}
%			\end{itemize}
			\item Concat
			\item Zip
			\item Feedback
			\item \textit{$<$many RxMobile operators$>$}
			\item Lift and LiftA2 (as generalizing over all operators)
		\end{itemize}
		\item Ball tracker example with the API
	\end{itemize}
